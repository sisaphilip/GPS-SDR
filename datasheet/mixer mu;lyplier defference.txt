I am just wondering that, multiplier and Mixer all have the abality to
convert frequency, so what is the difference between them? and in the
transiver and receiver, we use mixer to up-down transfer the frequency,
why not multiplier???

A multiplier calculates A(t)xB(t), A and B being analog signals

A mixer is a device able to upconvert or downconvert a RF signal, thanks to
a multiplication. But usual (diode-based) mixers calculate something like
A(t) x sign(B(t)), and not A(t)xB(t).

So a multiplier IS a mixer, but a mixer is often not an actual plain
multiplier.

Cheers,
Robert

-- and a mixer, because it isn't a plain multiplier, often outperforms a
multiplier at the task of mixing RF signals, generally for a lower price.

This gets into semantics and convention. Historically, a multiplier has one
input and 1 output. So, F(out)= nF(in) where n is an integer. It is not
amplitude linear, but was widely used in FM transmitters. A mixer has two
inputs, is generally linear, and the output contains the sum and difference
frequencies of the two inputs. A mixer does not have to be linear; a logic
Exclusive-OR gate is an excellent mixer. Any of these reqquires a filter at
the output to select the correct signal.

It's also a four-quadrant multiplier.

An RF mixer is never linear. Non-linearity is a *requirement* for correct
amplitude modulation. The only valid context for "linear" in RF mixer
discussions is in discussions of the transmitter's signal envelope and the
received signal waveform; they are essentially the same, so the result of
the modulation is considered linear.

OK, I used the term loosly, meaning the amplitude and sideband information
are retained.

I don't know that it's 'loose'. An analogue mixer (frequency-changer)
is internally non-linear but externally linear. You can tell, because
people want to know the overall intermodulation distortion
characteristic, although they call it 'third-order intercept'.

OTOH, an audio mixer had better be linear, linear, LINEAR. Unless it has
fuzz (and/or several other toys) built-in as a feature. That sort of
mixer is an adder, not a multiplier.

to the question #1:

mixing occurs whenever you apply a signal (like a simple ideal
sinusoidal voltage) to the input of a non-linear block, meaning a
black-box with a non-linear descriptive function, or a non-linear
relationship between output and input.
(Note that you cannot say a non-linear transfer function, because the
concept of a transfer function is based on the hypothesis of linearity)

Any non-linearity is ok for mixing, but where does multiplication come
out?
Consider a signal as the collection of its frequency components, i.e.
spectrum lines, which you can represent with a sinusoidal signal.
Well, good old mathematicians assure us that any non-linearity (among
those physically found in any actual device) can be expanded in a power
serie like:

Fn(x) = x^0 + x^1 + x^2 +....+x^n

eventually infinite. And here are the multiplications: x^2 = x * x ,
and so on..
So, the multiplications are required for mixing and a multiplier is a
mixer.

to the question #2:

Suppose to take a multiplier and to apply the two frequencies you want
to mix f1 and f2 to its inputs. If the multiplier is ideal, doing the
math shows that

A1*cos(2pi*f1 * t+phi1) * A2*cos(2pi*f2 * t+phi2)

gives exactly what you want: f1+f2 and f1-f2, then with a simple filter
you keep the one you like.
unfortunately multipliers are not ideal because the single devices are
themself non-linear (besides the whole circuit) and you'll find that
the output signal will have different terms (with suitable
multiplicative constants)

K , x1,x2, x1^2,x2^2,x1*x2,x1^2 * x2 , x1*x2^2 ....
| \ / \ / \ /
| \/ \ / \ /
order0 order1 order 2 order 3


with typically at lease three or four significant orders. if x1 and x2
are sinusoids, yuo'll have: f1 +/- f2, 2*f1 +/- f2, f1 +/- 2*f2, and
much much more
All of this is unacceptable if you have to do frequency conversione in
a transceiver, because you'll spread "dirt" frequencies all around the
spectrum !! ==> no FCC certification ==> no market ==> no money.
Moreover it would also be extremely expensive to buil a filter capable
of filtering out the extra frequency you get.

So, what's a mixer? it's a clever circuit which performs x1 * x2 in a
particular way, so that the multiplicative constants of the higher
order terms are __zero__ and therefore do not contribute.
To see how this is possible, look for:
"balanced mixers" --> zeros out unwanted order 1 terms
"double-balanced mixers" --> zeros out unwanted order 1 and 2 terms
"triple-balanced mixers" --> guess what?

Have fun,

Roberto

The mathematical propellorhead term for a good multiplier is "bilinear",
i.e. the output depends linearly on each of two inputs. It isn't true
that the internals have to be nonlinear--e.g. a Gilbert cell with
linearizing diodes, where the multiplication comes from the very
accurately bilinear current splitting of the diff pairs. Even if you
leave off the diodes, a diff pair is linear in one input (the emitter
current) and has a tanh characteristic in the other (delta-Vbe).
