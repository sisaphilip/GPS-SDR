High Sensitivity GPS

    for Cunsumer

The GPS signal uses a modulation scheme called CDMA for spectrum diffused transmission. The spectrum diffused signal is buried by natural noise. The GPS receiver contains a duplicate of the diffusion code in correlation to the transmitted signal, and uses overlap processing (inverse diffusion) to extract the buried signal from the noise.

The signal is so weak that a normal GPS receiver cannot determine a position in areas obstructed by buildings, etc. For these situations, a high sensitivity receiver is required.

A high sensitivity receiver is a GPS receiver that can extract and calculate a position from a weak signal that is 1/1000 of a typical outdoor signal. With this kind of sensitivity, a position can be calculated in many different indoor situations. This type of receiver is designed to improve upon the weaknesses of GPS receivers that do not perform well inside buildings or obstructed areas, and can be used indoors or underneath elevated structures.

To extract a weak signal that is only 1/1000 the strength of a normal signal, an especially large amount of correlation processing is required for a sustained period. Correlation processing allows a signal to be targeted from the confusing mix of false signals generated by noise and other satellites aside from the target satellite.

Circuit with a number of correlators, necessary for high precision positioning, is effectively integrated into the the high-sensitivity GPS receiver chip "eRideOPUS 5" in high density by utilising our proprietary technology. This, when combined with the latest low voltage C-MOS RF circuit, becomes a complete Single Chip (Die) GPS receiver.

The high sensitivity receiver combines Assisted GPS and Self Ephemeris capabilities to allow for fast Cold Start functionality in interior and obstructed environments where the signal is weak.

Assisted GPS

    for Cunsumer

The GPS receiver must receive a signal from a GPS satellite to acquire the exact position information of that satellite and calculate its own position accordingly (for information on the GPS, please refer to [What is GPS? ]).
The orbital and navigational data of the GPS satellite is contained within this signal. This data is broken into 30 second blocks, the first 18 seconds of which contain the data needed for accurate satellite positioning, known as ephemeris data.

A GPS receiver reads the signal transmitted by the GPS satellite and decodes the navigational information within the signal, and by accurately pinpointing the satellite's position is then able to calculate its own position based on that of the satellite. To that end, a GPS receiver with no navigational information cannot calculate its position until it has the proper ephemeris data

The signal level to decode the navigational information in the received signal must be greater than the receivable signal level from the GPS satellite (eRideOPUS 5 can receive an up to -162 dBm signal). The signal level is generally -145 dBm (eRideOPUS 5SD can decode up to -146 dBm signal). A signal level that is higher than -145 dBm must be received continuously for at least 18 seconds in order for the GPS receiver to obtain the ephemeris data.

This signal level is adequate for using the GPS receiver in an open air environment, but in an obstructed environment, a signal level of only -145 dBm or less may be receivable. When inside a building, for example, only a signal below-145 dBm may be receivable, and even a signal over -145 dBm may not be continuously receivable in an urban environment with many tall buildings. In this case, even when the signal from the satellite can be received, the ephemeris cannot be decoded and the GPS receiver position cannot be attained.

The most recently received ephemeris data from the current target satellite has an expiration period of 4 hours, after which the ephemeris data cannot be used and the satellite position will be lost. All ephemeris data received by the GPS receiver will soon become unusable, so the ephemeris data must be updated in fixed periods of every 2-4 hours.

When using a GPS receiver in a situation such as in a building, where only a weak signal can be received, it may be necessary to periodically receive the orbital information of the target satellite from a source other than the GPS satellite itself. This data is called assisted GPS data, and the GPS receiver that uses the assisted GPS data to aid in the calculating of its position is called an Assisted GPS. Assisted GPS data can be provided to the GPS receiver from any network- or internet-connected assist server

A GPS receiver can receive the following advantages when using assisted GPS data:

    Continuous position tracking with high sensitivity signal level (-162 dBm).
    Positioning within a few seconds of operating the GPS and receiving the assist data.
    Reduction of power consumption by reducing the time it takes to receive navigational data from the GPS satellite and calculate the current position.

Accordingly, the Furuno/eRide Assisted GPS can also provide the data listed below, for more convenient and accurate positioning.

Max. 7 day Satellite orbital data
    Use updated orbital positioning data for a longer expiration period than usual.
