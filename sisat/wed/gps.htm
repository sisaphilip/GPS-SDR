<h2 class="subsection"><a id="gps"></a>The GPS system</h2>
<p>
   The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a worldwide radio-navigation system
   formed from a constellation of 24 satellites, each in its own orbit 11,000
   nautical miles above the Earth, and five ground stations that make sure the
   satellites are working properly. The GPS satellites each take 12 hours to
   orbit the Earth.
</p>
<p>
   GPS uses these satellites as reference points to calculate positions accurate
   to just a few meters. In fact, with advanced forms of GPS you can make
   measurements to better than a centimeter! Each satellite is equipped with an
   accurate clock to let it broadcast signals coupled with a precise time
   message. The ground unit receives the satellite signal, which travels at the
   speed of light. Even at this speed, the signal takes a measurable amount of
   time to reach the receiver.  The difference between the time the signal is
   sent and the time it is received, multiplied by the speed of light, enables
   the receiver to calculate the distance to the satellite.  Here's a graphic to
   illustrate the complete
   functionality.<br><span class="displayed"><img src="gps_files/gps__3.png" alt="MATH"></span><br>
</p>
<p>
   <br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
   GPS receivers have been miniaturized to just a few integrated circuits and so
   are becoming very economical. And that makes the technology accessible to
   virtually everyone. These days GPS is finding its way into cars, boats,
   planes, construction equipment, movie making gear, farm machinery, even laptop
   computers. Soon GPS will become almost as basic as the telephone.
</p>
<h3 class="subsubsection">How does it work?</h3>
<p>
   Here's how GPS works in five steps:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      <p>
         The basis of GPS is "triangulation" from satellites.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         To "triangulate," a GPS receiver measures distance using the travel time of
         radio signals.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         To measure travel time, GPS needs very accurate timing.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         Along with distance, you need to know exactly where the satellites are in
         space.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         Finally you must correct for any delays the signal experiences as it travels
         through the atmosphere. You must also correct for the clock differences
         between the GPS receiver and the satellites.
      </p>
   </li>
</ol>
<p>
   The triangulation step is something like this. You have at hand your trusty
   GPS receiver. What the GPS <strong>can</strong> do is precisely measure your
   distance from any one of a number of satellites.  From Satellite 1
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="23px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:2px"><img src="gps_files/gps__4.png" alt="$(S_{1})$" align="bottom" height="21px" width="26px"></span></span>
   your device (GPS unit) measures your distance from the satellite to be 11,000
   miles away, then you can only localize yourself on a circle on the earth that
   is the locus of all points 11,000 miles from
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="23px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:2px"><img src="gps_files/gps__5.png" alt="$S_{1}.$" align="bottom" height="21px" width="20px"></span></span>
   Now from From Satellite 2
   (<span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="23px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:2px"><img src="gps_files/gps__6.png" alt="$S_{2})$" align="bottom" height="21px" width="20px"></span></span>
   your GPS unit measures your distance from the satellite to be 12,000 miles
   away.  Now you are localized to be on the intersection of the spheres centered
   at the satellites and of the respective radii.  The intersection of the
   spheres is a circle.  Next, obtaining the distance from a third satellite
   (<span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="23px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:2px"><img src="gps_files/gps__7.png" alt="$S_{3}$" align="bottom" height="21px" width="14px"></span></span>)
   allows us to locate in the intersection of the three spheres and this
   intersection is two points (A circle intersected by a sphere is two points, in
   general.) One of the points is where you are
   <img src="gps_files/gps__8.png" alt="gps__8.png">. The other point is rarely on the
   planet's surface and so by a little reckoning,  you can eliminate this
   possibility and select your location. This is broad strokes is how its done.
   But there are fine details and they lie in computing those distances.
</p>
<p>
   <br><span class="displayed"><img src="gps_files/gps__10.png" alt="MATH"></span><br>Another
   view of the same situation shows the spheres centered at the satellites. In
   the picture below, The planet earth is the small circle toward the middle of
   the intersection of the spheres.
   <br><span class="displayed"><img src="gps_files/gps__12.png" alt="MATH"></span><br>Here's
   the easy way to see that observations from four satellites can give the exact
   position.<br><span class="displayed"><img src="gps_files/gps__15.png" alt="MATH"></span><br><br>
   *In each event, your position is on the locus of result points.<br><br>Now
   most GPS units search for and determine measurements from as many as six
   satellites.  This can only improve the accuracy using least squares methods.
   Here is a <a href="http://www.math.tamu.edu/%7Edallen/physics/gps/least%5Cleastsquares.htm"> link</a> to further information on
   least squares.
</p>
<h3 class="subsubsection">How exactly is the distance computed?</h3>
<p>
   We now know that if we have the locations of the satellites and distances from
   us, we can accurately determine our position.  But we need to know how the
   distance is computed.   In fact there are a couple of ways.  Here are some
   methods to compute distance.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <p>
         Direct measurement with a "ruler."
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         Inferred distances by measuring angles in triangles.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         Distance measurement using the speed of light (light propagation time).<br>
      </p>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   As mentioned above GPS methods are related to measuring light propagation time
   but not directly.  How to measure distance by light? There are a couple of
   methods.  First, distance can be measured directly by sending a pulse and
   measuring how it takes to travel between two points. This most common method
   is to reflect the signal and the time between when the pulse was transmitted
   and when the reflected signal returns. Such systems, called bi-directional,
   are used in radar and satellite laser ranging that require single millimeter
   accuracy.  They require a clock capable of timing accuracy of
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="23px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:2px"><img src="gps_files/gps__16.png" alt="$3x10^{-12}$" align="bottom" height="21px" width="49px"></span></span>seconds
   (3 picoseconds).  The clock stability need is
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="45px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:10px"><img src="gps_files/gps__17.png" alt="MATH" align="bottom" height="35px" width="81px"></span></span>.
   A clock with this longtime stability would gain or lose 0.03 seconds in a
   year.  Such equipment is expensive, costing for satellites about $1m.  More on
   this later.
</p>
<h3 class="subsubsection">Back to the GPS </h3>
<p>
   If we know the transit time of a signal and the speed of propagation of the
   signal, then we can determine the distance or range.  Since the GPS receiver
   clock is not perfectly sychronized with the satellite clock, the ranges are in
   error.  For that reason they are called <em>pseudoranges</em>.  We must
   determine the time offset between the clocks to accurately measure the
   distances.
</p>
<p>
   Assuming we have the distances from four satellites and we know
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="25px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:3px"><img src="gps_files/gps__18.png" alt="MATH" align="bottom" height="22px" width="60px"></span></span>, <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="23px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:2px"><img src="gps_files/gps__19.png" alt="$i=1,2,3,4$" align="bottom" height="21px" width="75px"></span></span>
   are the exact postions of the satellites, we must then solve the following
   system equations where the
   .<br><span class="displayed"><img src="gps_files/gps__20.png" alt="MATH"></span><br>where
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="23px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:2px"><img src="gps_files/gps__21.png" alt="$c$" align="bottom" height="21px" width="6px"></span></span>
   is the speed of light and
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="23px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:2px"><img src="gps_files/gps__22.png" alt="$t_{B}$" align="bottom" height="21px" width="12px"></span></span>
   is the receiver clock offset time.  The receiver clock offset is the
   difference between GPS time and internal receiver time. Obviously, a key
   portion of all this is that there is just one clock offset time.  This means
   the all the satellites must have perfectly synchronized clocks, and this is
   just one of the tasks of the control sites.  The unknowns above are
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="25px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:3px"><img src="gps_files/gps__23.png" alt="$x,~y,~z,$" align="bottom" height="22px" width="47px"></span></span>
   and
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="23px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:2px"><img src="gps_files/gps__24.png" alt="$t_{B}$" align="bottom" height="21px" width="12px"></span></span>.
   Let us reiterate: if the clocks of the GPS receiver and the satellite were
   perfectly synchronized, the time offset would be zero.
   <br><span class="displayed"><img src="gps_files/gps__26.png" alt="MATH"></span><br>The
   GPS receiver is not just a fine electronic mechanism, it can do a whole lot of
   mathematics as well.  Wow and they put it in such a small package!
</p>
<h3 class="subsubsection">Still more math</h3>
<p>
   Just how is that system solved?  It is multivariate and nonlinear.  There are
   numerous methods that have been designed for just such systems.  Most notably
   is the famous Newton's method. We have provided a link to the basics of the
   Newton's method for functions of one variable.  In a nutshell... To solve the
   equation
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="25px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:3px"><img src="gps_files/gps__27.png" alt="MATH" align="bottom" height="22px" width="54px"></span></span>,
   make an initial guess
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="23px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:2px"><img src="gps_files/gps__28.png" alt="$x_{0}$" align="bottom" height="21px" width="14px"></span></span>,
   compute
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="59px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:17px"><img src="gps_files/gps__29.png" alt="MATH" align="bottom" height="42px" width="113px"></span></span>.
   Then replace
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="23px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:2px"><img src="gps_files/gps__30.png" alt="$x_{0}$" align="bottom" height="21px" width="14px"></span></span>
   in the expression
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="59px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:17px"><img src="gps_files/gps__31.png" alt="MATH" align="bottom" height="42px" width="77px"></span></span>
   with
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="23px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:2px"><img src="gps_files/gps__32.png" alt="$x_{1}$" align="bottom" height="21px" width="14px"></span></span>
   and compute
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="23px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:2px"><img src="gps_files/gps__33.png" alt="$x_{2}$" align="bottom" height="21px" width="14px"></span></span>
   and continue in this manner. That is, we compute
   <br><span class="displayed"><img src="gps_files/gps__34.png" alt="MATH"></span><br>and
   continue to do so until the value of
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="25px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:3px"><img src="gps_files/gps__35.png" alt="MATH" align="bottom" height="22px" width="32px"></span></span>
   is sufficiently close to zero.<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
   In the <em>general multivariate</em> case the same equation works, but has a
   slightly different look.  Let
   <br><span class="displayed"><img src="gps_files/gps__36.png" alt="MATH"></span><br>be
   the sytem to be solved., where
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="25px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:3px"><img src="gps_files/gps__37.png" alt="$\QTR{bf}{f}$" align="bottom" height="22px" width="5px"></span></span>

</p>
<p>
   Convergence problems for Newton's method are legend.  However, if we have a
   good starting value, then Newton's method often converges rapidly.  You can
   see more about this in our one dimensional treatment.
</p>
<h3 class="subsubsection">Sources of position location error</h3>
<p>
   There are many sources of error in GPS measurement. Among them are the
   atmosphere, ionosphere, satellite orbit errors, receiver noise, multipath
   ambiguities, and satellite clock errors.
</p>
<p>
   A number of other corrections and tricks are required to obtain precise
   distances.  Sometimes GPS units use dual frequency transmission, in part
   because ionospheric errors that are inherent in all observations can be
   modelled and significantly reduced by combining satellite observations made on
   two different frequencies and observations on two frequencies allow for faster
   ambiguity resolution times.
</p>
<p>
   Until recently, another source of error was intentionally created. However, as
   of August 2000, the Selective Availability of the signal, an intentional
   degradation of the signal, was turned off.  Therefore, accuracies of the
   horizontal position is in the 5-7 meter range. <br>
</p>
<h3 class="subsubsection">Optical systems</h3>
<p>
   With optical systems, a flat reflector does not work because of the obvious
   need that the light signal be exactly perpendicular to the ranging mirror.
   So, what is commonly used is a corner cube reflector, as shown below.
   <br><span class="displayed"><img src="gps_files/gps__51.png" alt="MATH"></span><br>
</p>
<p>
   An alternative method to measure distance is to measure the phase difference
   between the incoming and outgoing continuous wave.  Such a device is called an
   <em>interferometer</em>.
</p>
<p>
   The mathematics behind this is elementary trigonometry.  Suppose the outgoing
   signal is given by
   <br><span class="displayed"><img src="gps_files/gps__52.png" alt="MATH"></span><br>and
   also the
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="23px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:2px"><img src="gps_files/gps__53.png" alt="$\pi /2$" align="bottom" height="21px" width="21px"></span></span>
   lagged signal
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="23px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:2px"><img src="gps_files/gps__54.png" alt="MATH" align="bottom" height="21px" width="69px"></span></span>.
   The incoming signal is of the same frequency but out of phase. Thus we receive
   the signal
   <br><span class="displayed"><img src="gps_files/gps__55.png" alt="MATH"></span><br>When
   the signal returned it is multiplied (beating) by the outgoing signal to
   obtain
   <br><span class="displayed"><img src="gps_files/gps__56.png" alt="MATH"></span><br>We
   apply the trig
   identities<br><span class="displayed"><img src="gps_files/gps__57.png" alt="MATH"></span><br>to
   obtain<br><span class="displayed"><img src="gps_files/gps__58.png" alt="MATH"></span><br>The
   terms

   and
   <span class="inline-math-graphics"><img src="gps_files/swptransparent.gif" alt="" align="top" border="none" height="23px" width="1px"><span style="position:relative; top:2px"><img src="gps_files/gps__60.png" alt="$\sin 4\pi \omega t$" align="bottom" height="21px" width="51px"></span></span>
   oscillate at twice the frequency of the original signal.  By averaging over

   we obtain zero.  The remaining terms are the sine and cosine of the phase.
</p>

   Do we have the distance now?  Not quite.  If the distance is less than 1
   wavelength, then the answer is unique.  If the distance is more than 1
   wavelength, then we need to number of integer cycles.  Surveying instruments
   use this and make phase difference measurements at multiple frequencies, then
   solve the resulting system of equations to determine the distance.

         Suppose you have the phase angle pertaining to exactly two different frequency
         reflections.  How can this help you better obtain the distance between the GPS
         and the satellite?

         Explain why solving the system
         <br><span class="displayed"><img src="gps_files/gps__65.png" alt="MATH"></span><br>given
         the positions of and distances from three satellites does not yield the
         unique, exact GPS receiver position.  There are after all, three equations and
         three unknowns.  Note there is no time offset in this situation.

         One way to solve the system above is by squaring both sides and computing
         differences of pairs of equations and solving the resulting system.  Show that
         with four satellite distances, we can convert the system to a linear system
         for the three unknowns
