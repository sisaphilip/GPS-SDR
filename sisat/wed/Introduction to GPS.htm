<h3 align="center">Chapter One: What is GPS?</h3>

<p>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a location system based on a constellation of
about 24 satellites orbiting the earth at altitudes of approximately 11,000 miles. GPS was
developed by the United States Department of Defense (DOD), for its tremendous application
as a military locating utility. The DOD's investment in GPS is immense. Billions and
billions of dollars have been invested in creating this technology for military uses.
However, over the past several years, GPS has proven to be a useful tool in non-military
mapping applications as well. </p>

<p>GPS satellites are orbited high enough to avoid the problems associated with land based
systems, yet can provide accurate positioning 24 hours a day, anywhere in the world.
Uncorrected positions determined from GPS satellite signals produce accuracies in the
range of 50 to 100 meters. When using a technique called differential correction, users
can get positions accurate to within 5 meters or less. </p>

<p>Today, many industries are leveraging off the DOD's massive undertaking. As GPS units
are becoming smaller and less expensive, there are an expanding number of applications for
GPS. In transportation applications, GPS assists pilots and drivers in pinpointing their
locations and avoiding collisions. Farmers can use GPS to guide equipment and control
accurate distribution of fertilizers and other chemicals. Recreationally, GPS is used for
providing accurate locations and as a navigation tool for hikers, hunters and boaters. </p>

<p>Many would argue that GPS has found its greatest utility in the field of Geographic
Information Systems (GIS). With some consideration for error, GPS can provide any point on
earth with a unique address (its precise location). A GIS is basically a descriptive
database of the earth (or a specific part of the earth). GPS tells you that you are at
point X,Y,Z while GIS tells you that X,Y,Z is an oak tree, or a spot in a stream with a pH
level of 5.4. GPS tells us the "where". GIS tells us the "what".
GPS/GIS is reshaping the way we locate, organize, analyze and map our resources. </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Two: Trilateration - How GPS Determines a Location</h3>

<p>In a nutshell, GPS is based on satellite ranging - calculating the distances between
the receiver and the position of 3 or more satellites (4 or more if elevation is desired)
and then applying some good old mathematics. Assuming the positions of the satellites are
known, the location of the receiver can be calculated by determining the distance from
each of the satellites to the receiver. GPS takes these 3 or more known references and
measured distances and "triangulates" an additional position. </p>

<p>As an example, assume that I have asked you to find me at a stationary position based
upon a few clues which I am willing to give you. First, I tell you that I am exactly 10
miles away from your house. You would know I am somewhere on the perimeter of a sphere
that has an origin as your house and a radius of 10 miles. With this information alone,
you would have a difficult time to find me since there are an infinite number of locations
on the perimeter of that sphere. </p>

<p>Second, I tell you that I am also exactly 12 miles away from the ABC Grocery Store. Now
you can define a second sphere with its origin at the store and a radius of 12 miles. You
know that I am located somewhere in the space where the perimeters of these two spheres
intersect - but there are still many possibilities to define my location. </p>

<p>Adding additional spheres will further reduce the number of possible locations. In
fact, a third origin and distance (I tell you am 8 miles away from the City Clock) narrows
my position down to just 2 points. By adding one more sphere, you can pinpoint my exact
location. Actually, the 4th sphere may not be necessary. One of the possibilities may not
make sense, and therefore can be eliminated. </p>

<p>For example, if you know I am above sea level, you can reject a point that has negative
elevation. Mathematics and computers allow us to determine the correct point with only 3
satellites. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="Introduction%20to%20GPS_files/trilat2.gif" alt="" height="262" width="323"> </p>

<p>Based on this example, you can see that you need to know the following information in
order to compute your position: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A) What is the precise location of three or more known points (GPS satellites)? <br>
  B) What is the distance between the known points and the position of the GPS receiver? </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Three: How the Current Locations of GPS Satellites are
Determined</h3>

<p>GPS satellites are orbiting the Earth at an altitude of 11,000 miles. The DOD can
predict the paths of the satellites vs. time with great accuracy. Furthermore, the
satellites can be periodically adjusted by huge land-based radar systems. Therefore, the
orbits, and thus the locations of the satellites, are known in advance. Today's GPS
receivers store this orbit information for all of the GPS satellites in what is known as
an <b>almanac</b>. Think of the almanac as a "bus schedule" advising you of
where each satellite will be at a particular time. Each GPS satellite continually
broadcasts the almanac. Your GPS receiver will automatically collect this information and
store it for future reference. </p>

<p>The Department of Defense constantly monitors the orbit of the satellites looking for
deviations from predicted values. Any deviations (caused by natural atmospheric phenomenon
such as gravity), are known as <b>ephemeris</b><i> </i>errors. When ephemeris errors are
determined to exist for a satellite, the errors are sent back up to that satellite, which
in turn broadcasts the errors as part of the standard message, supplying this information
to the GPS receivers. </p>

<p>By using the information from the almanac in conjuction with the ephemeris error data,
the position of a GPS satellite can be very precisely determined for a given time. </p>

<p><a name="chap4"></a></p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Four: Computing the Distance Between Your Position and the GPS
Satellites</h3>

<p>GPS determines distance between a GPS satellite and a GPS receiver by measuring the
amount of time it takes a radio signal (the GPS signal) to travel from the satellite to
the receiver. Radio waves travel at the speed of light, which is about 186,000 miles per
second. So, if the amount of time it takes for the signal to travel from the satellite to
the receiver is known, the distance from the satellite to the receiver (distance = speed x
time) can be determined. If the exact time when the signal was transmitted and the exact
time when it was received are known, the signal's travel time can be determined. </p>

<p>In order to do this, the satellites and the receivers use very accurate clocks which
are synchronized so that they generate the same code at exactly the same time. The code
received from the satellite can be compared with the code generated by the receiver. By
comparing the codes, the time difference between when the satellite generated the code and
when the receiver generated the code can be determined. This interval is the travel time
of the code. Multiplying this travel time, in seconds, by 186,000 miles per second gives
the distance from the receiver position to the satellite in miles. </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Five: Four (4) Satellites to give a 3D position</h3>

<p>In the previous example, you saw that it took only 3 measurements to
"triangulate" a 3D position. However, GPS needs a 4th satellite to provide a 3D
position. Why?? </p>

<p>Three measurements can be used to locate a point, assuming the GPS receiver and
satellite clocks are precisely and continually synchronized, thereby allowing the distance
calculations to be accurately determined. Unfortunately, it is impossible to synchronize
these two clocks, since the clocks in GPS receivers are not as accurate as the very
precise and expensive atomic clocks in the satellites. The GPS signals travel from the
satellite to the receiver very fast, so if the two clocks are off by only a small
fraction, the determined position data may be considerably distorted. </p>

<p>The atomic clocks aboard the satellites maintain their time to a very high degree of
accuracy. However, there will always be a slight variation in clock rates from satellite
to satellite. Close monitoring of the clock of each satellite from the ground permits the
control station to insert a message in the signal of each satellite which precisely
describes the drift rate of that satellite's clock. The insertion of the drift rate
effectively synchronizes all of the GPS satellite clocks. </p>

<p>The same procedure cannot be applied to the clock in a GPS receiver. Therefore, a
fourth variable (in addition to x, y and z), time, must be determined in order to
calculate a precise location. Mathematically, to solve for four unknowns (x,y,z, and t),
there must be four equations. In determining GPS positions, the four equations are
represented by signals from four different satellites. </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Six: The GPS Error Budget</h3>

<p>The GPS system has been designed to be as nearly accurate as possible. However, there
are still errors. Added together, these errors can cause a deviation of <b>+/- 50 -100</b>
meters from the actual GPS receiver position. There are several sources for these errors,
the most significant of which are discussed below: </p>

<h4>Atmospheric Conditions</h4>

<p>The ionosphere and troposphere both refract the GPS signals. This causes the speed of
the GPS signal in the ionosphere and troposphere to be different from the speed of the GPS
signal in space. Therefore, the distance calculated from "Signal Speed x Time"
will be different for the portion of the GPS signal path that passes through the
ionosphere and troposphere and for the portion that passes through space. </p>

<h4>Ephemeris Errors/Clock Drift/Measurement Noise</h4>

<p>As mentioned earlier, GPS signals contain information about ephemeris (orbital
position) errors, and about the rate of clock drift for the broadcasting satellite. The
data concerning ephemeris errors may not exactly model the true satellite motion or the
exact rate of clock drift. Distortion of the signal by measurement noise can further
increase positional error. The disparity in ephemeris data can introduce 1-5 meters of
positional error, clock drift disparity can introduce 0-1.5 meters of positional error and
measurement noise can introduce 0-10 meters of positional error. </p>

<h4>Selective Availability</h4>

<p>Ephemeris errors should not be confused with Selective Availability (SA), which is the
intentional alteration of the time and epherimis signal by the Department of Defense. SA
can introduce 0-70 meters of positional error. Fortunately, positional errors caused by SA
can be removed by differential correction. </p>

<h4>Multipath</h4>

<p>A GPS signal bouncing off a reflective surface prior to reaching the GPS receiver
antenna is referred to as multipath. Because it is difficult to completely correct
multipath error, even in high precision GPS units, multipath error is a serious concern to
the GPS user. </p>

<p>The chart below lists the most common sources of error in GPS positions. This chart is
commonly known as the GPS Error Budget: </p>

<h4>GPS Error Budget</h4>

<pre>Source			Uncorrected Error Level
Ionosphere		0-30 meters
Troposphere		0-30 meters
Measurement Noise	0-10 meters
Ephemeris Data		1-5 meters
Clock Drift		0-1.5 meters
Multipath		0-1 meter
Selective Availability	0-70 meters

<h3 align="center">Chapter Seven: Measuring GPS Accuracy</h3>

<p>As discussed above, there are several external sources which introduce errors into a
GPS position. While the errors discussed above always affect accuracy, another major
factor in determining positional accuracy is the alignment, or geometry, of the group of
satellites (constellation) from which signals are being received. The geometry of the
constellation is evaluated for several factors, all of which fall into the category of
Dilution Of Precision, or DOP. </p>

<h4>DOP</h4>

<p>DOP is an indicator of the quality of the geometry of the satellite constellation. Your
computed position can vary depending on which satellites you use for the measurement.
Different satellite geometries can magnify or lessen the errors in the error budget
described above. A greater angle between the satellites lowers the DOP, and provides a
better measurement. A higher DOP indicates poor satellite geometry, and an inferior
measurement cofiguration. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="Introduction%20to%20GPS_files/gooddops.gif" height="266" width="356"><br>
<img src="Introduction%20to%20GPS_files/baddops.gif" height="266" width="356"><br>
</p>

<p>Some GPS receivers can analyze the positions of the satellites available, based upon
the almanac, and choose those satellites with the best geometry in order to make the DOP
as low as possible. Another important GPS receiver feature is to be able to ignore or
eliminate GPS readings with DOP values that exceed user-defined limits. Other GPS
receivers may have the ability to use all of the satellites in view, thus minimizing the
DOP as much as possible. </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Eight: Using Differential GPS to Increase Accuracy </h3>

<p>As powerful as GPS is, +/-50 - 100 meters of uncertainty is not acceptable in many
applications. How can we obtain higher accuracies? </p>

<p>A technique called <b>differential correction </b>is necessary to get accuracies within
1 -5 meters, or even better, with advanced equipment. Differential correction requires a
second GPS receiver, a<i> base station, </i>collecting data at a stationary position on a
precisely known point (typically it is a surveyed benchmark). Because the physical
location of the base station is known, a correction factor can be computed by comparing
the known location with the GPS location determined by using the satellites. </p>

<p>The differential correction process takes this correction factor and applies it to the
GPS data collected by a GPS receiver in the field. Differential correction eliminates most
of the errors listed in the GPS Error Budget discussed earlier. After differential
correction, the GPS Error Budget changes as follows: </p>

<h4>GPS Error Budget</h4>

<pre>Source		Uncorrected	With Differential
Ionosphere	0-30 meters	Mostly Removed
Troposphere	0-30 meters	All Removed
Signal Noise	0-10 meters	All Removed
Ephemeris Data	1-5 meters	All Removed
Clock Drift	0-1.5 meters	All Removed
Multipath	0-1 meters	Not Removed
SA		0-70 meters	All Removed
</pre>

<p>By eliminating many of the above errors, differential correction allows GPS positions
to be computed at a much higher level of accuracy. </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Nine: Levels of GPS Accuracy</h3>

<p>There are three types of GPS receivers which are available in today's marketplace. Each
of the three types offers different levels of accuracy, and has different requirements to
obtain those accuracies. To this point, the discussion in this book has focused on Coarse
Acquisition (C/A code) GPS receivers. The two remaining types of GPS receiver are Carrier
Phase receivers and Dual Frequency receivers. </p>

<h4>C/A Code receivers</h4>

<p>C/A Code receivers typically provide 1-5 meter GPS position accuracy with differential
correction. C/A Code GPS receivers provide a sufficient degree of accuracy to make them
useful in most GIS applications. </p>

<p>C/A Code receivers can provide 1-5 meter GPS position accuracy with an occupation time
of 1 second. Longer occupation times (up to 3 minutes) will provide GPS position
accuracies consistently within 1-3 meters. Recent advances in GPS receiver design will now
allow a C/A Code receiver to provide sub-meter accuracy, down to 30 cm. </p>

<h4>Carrier Phase receivers</h4>

<p>Carrier Phase receivers typically provide 10-30 cm GPS position accuracy with
differential correction. Carrier Phase receivers provide the higher level of accuracy
demanded by certain GIS applications. </p>

<p>Carrier Phase receivers measure the distance from the receiver to the satellites by
counting the number of waves that carry the C/A Code signal. This method of determining
position is much more accurate; however, it does require a substatially higher occupation
time to attain 10-30 cm accuracy. Initializing a Carrier Phase GPS job on a known point
requires an occupation time of about 5 minutes. Initializing a Carrier Phase GPS job on an
unknown point requires an occupation time of about 30-40 minutes. </p>

<p>Additional requirements, such as maintaining the same satellite constellation
throughout the job, performance under canopy and the need to be very close to a base
station, limit the applicability of Carrier Phase GPS receivers to many GIS applications. </p>

<h4>Dual-Frequency receivers</h4>

<p>Dual-Frequency receivers are capable of providing sub-centimeter GPS position accuracy
with differential correction. Dual-Frequency receivers provide "survey grade"
accuracies not often required for GIS applications. </p>

<p>Dual-Frequency receivers receive signals from the satellites on two frequencies
simultaneously. Receiving GPS signals on two frequencies simultaneously allows the
receiver to determine very precise positions. </p>

<hr noshade="noshade">

<p><a name="chap10"></a></p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Ten: GPS and Canopy</h3>

<p>GPS receivers require a line of sight to the satellites in order to obtain a signal
representative of the true distance from the satellite to the receiver. Therefore, any
object in the path of the signal has the potential to interfere with the reception of that
signal. Objects which can block a GPS signal include tree canopy, buildings and terrain
features. </p>

<p>Further, reflective surfaces can cause the GPS signals to bounce before arriving at a
receiver, thus causing an error in the distance calculation. This problem, known as
multipath, can be caused by a variety of materials including water, glass and metal. The
water contained in the leaves of vegatation can produce multipath error. In some
instances, operating under heavy, wet forest canopy can degrade the ability of a GPS
receiver to track satellites. </p>

<p>There are several data collection techniques which can mitigate the effects of signal
blockage by tree canopy or other objects. For example, many GPS receivers can be
instructed to track only the highest satellites in the sky, as opposed to those satellites
which provide the best DOP. Increasing the elevation of the GPS antenna can also
dramatically increase the ability of the receiver to track satellites. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, there will be locations where GPS signals simply are not available due
to obstruction. In these cases, there are additional techniques which can help to solve
the problem. Some GPS receivers have the ability to collect an offset point, which
involves recording a GPS position at a location where GPS signals are available while also
recording the distance, bearing and slope from the GPS antenna to the position of interest
where the GPS signals are not available. This technique is useful for avoiding a dense
timber stand or building. </p>

<p>Further, a traditional traverse program can be used to manually enter a series of
bearings and ranges to generate positions until satellite signals can again be received.
This position data can then be used to augment position data collected with the GPS
receiver. </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Eleven: GPS for GIS</h3>

<p>Up to this point, the discussion has focused on describing how GPS determines a
location on the surface of the Earth. Now the discussion can shift to the process of
describing what is at the location. The "what" is the object or objects which
will be mapped. These objects are referred to as "Features", and are used to
build a GIS. It is the power of GPS to precisely locate these Features which adds so much
to the utility of the GIS system. On the other hand, without Feature data, a coordinate
location is of little value. </p>

<h4>Feature Types</h4>

<p>There are three types of Feature which can be mapped: Points, Lines and Areas. A Point
Feature is a single GPS coordinate position which is identified with a specific Object. A
Line Feature is a collection of GPS positions which are identified with the same Object
and linked together to form a line. An Area Feature is very similar to a Line Feature,
except that the ends of the line are tied to each other to form a closed area. </p>

<h4>Describing Features</h4>

<p>As stated above, a Feature is the object which will be mapped by the GPS system. The
ability to describe a Feature in terms of a multi-layered database is essential for
successful integration with any GIS system. For example, it is possible to map the
location of each house on a city block and simply label each coordinate position as a
house. However, the addition of information such as color, size, cost, occupants, etc.
will provide the ability to sort and classify the houses by these catagories. </p>

<p>These catagories of descriptions for a Feature are know as Attributes. Attributes can
be thought of as questions which are asked about the Feature. Using the example above, the
Attributes of the Feature "house" would be "color", "size",
"cost" and "occupants". </p>

<p>Logically, each question asked by the Attributes must have an answer. The answers to
the questions posed by the Attributes are called Values. In the example above, an
appropriate Value (answer) for the Attribute (question) "color" may be
"blue". </p>

<p>The following table illustrates the relationship between Features, Attributes and
Values: </p>

<pre>Feature	Attribute	Value
House	Color		Blue
	Size		3 BDR
	Cost		$118K
	Occupants	5
</pre>

<p>By collecting the same type of data for each house which is mapped, a database is
created. Tying this database to position information is the core philosophy underlying any
GIS system. </p>

<h4>Feature Lists</h4>

<p>The field data entry process can be streamlined by the use of a Feature List. The
Feature List is a database which contains a listing of the Features which will be mapped,
as well as the associated Attributes for each Feature. In addition, the Feature List
contains a selection of appropriate Values for each Attribute. The Feature List can be
created on the CMT hand-held GPS data collector, or on a PC. Below is an example of a
Feature List as it appears in <a href="http://www.cmtinc.com/software/index.htm#pcgps">PC-GPS</a>: </p>

<p>When a Feature List is used in the field, the first step is to select the Feature to be
mapped. Once a Feature is selected, the Attributes for that Feature are automatically
listed. A Value for each Attribute can then be selected from the displayed list of
predetermined Values. </p>

<p>The use of a Feature List streamlines the data entry process and also ensures
consistent data entry among different users in the same organization. </p>

<h4>Exporting to a GIS System</h4>

<p>The final step in incorporating GPS data with a GIS system is to export the GPS and
Feature data into the GIS system. During this process, a GIS "layer" is created
for each Feature in the GPS job. For example, the process of exporting a GPS job which
contains data for House, Road and Lot Features would create a House layer, a Road layer
and a Lot layer in the GIS system. These layers can then be incorporated with existing GIS
data. </p>

<p>Once the GPS job has been exported, the full power of the GIS system can be used to
classify and evaluate the data. </p>

<b>- G -</b> <br>
</p>

<p><b>Geographic Information System (GIS) - </b>a mapping system which combines positional
data with descriptive information to form a layered map. </p>

<p><b>Global Positioning System (GPS)</b> - a system for providing precise location which
is based on data transmitted from a constellation of 24 satellites </p>

<p align="center"><br>
<b>- L -</b> <br>
</p>

<p><b>L-band -</b> the group of radio frequencies which carry the GPS data from the
satellites to the GPS receivers. </p>

<p align="center"><br>
<b>- M -</b> <br>
</p>

<p><b>Multipath - </b>the interference to a signal that has reached the receiver antenna
by multiple paths; usually caused by the signal being bounced or reflected. Signals from
satellites low on the horizon will have high multipath error. Receivers that can be
configured to "mask out" signals from such satellites can help minimize
multi-path. </p>

<p align="center"><br>
<b>- P -</b> <br>
</p>

<p><b>Pseudorange -</b> an uncorrected measurement of the distance between a GPS satellite
and a GPS receiver determined by comparing a code transmitted by the satellite to a code
generated by the receiver. </p>

<p align="center"><br>
<b>- R -</b> <br>
</p>

<p><b>Residual -</b> a quality indicator for a GPS position that is determined during the
differential correction process. Indicates uncorrectable error. High residuals are not
desirable. </p>

<p align="center"><br>
<b>- S -</b> <br>
</p>

<p><b>Satellite Constellation</b> <b>- </b>the group of GPS satellites from which data is
used to determine a position. </p>

<p><b>Static Positioning -</b> the process of averaging GPS positions taken successively
over a period of time with a stationary antenna to increase accuracy. </p>

<p align="center"><br>
<b>- V -</b> <br>
</p>

<p><b>Value -</b> descriptive information about a Feature. Values can be thought of as the
answers to the questions posed by Attributes. </p>
