demodulation bpsk
The previous mathematical description explains the principle behind coherent BPSK demodulation. 
Such a structure is straightforward and lends itself well to understanding the concepts. However,
 it is difficult to implement this circuit 
because its performance is poor when non-ideal components are used. With some modification
 (see Figure 4), the demodulator circuit becomes much more practical. The requirements placed
 on the building blocks of the structure become far less demanding to achieve good performance.
 The more realizable BPSK demodulator is based on a practical mixer that is allowed to be imperfect. 
Such a mixer can be built using common semiconductor devices with small current requirements. Unlike
 an ideal multiplier, easily implementable mixers are subject to overloading and high-order
 non-linearities; undesired radio signals, which need not exist at even similar frequencies, 
can mix in a complicated manner to produce undesired interference that superimposes the desired
 
demodulation product. The solution is to place a channel filter before the mixer to preclude as 
much off-channel energy from reaching the mixer as possible. The most common inexpensive channel
 filters are second- and third-order surface acoustic wave (SAW) and ceramic type. However, neither
 type exhibits ideal rectangular characteristics.
